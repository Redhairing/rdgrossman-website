Hi! I'm Ryan! 

I am a data scientist based in Los Angeles. I live here with my wife (Ceili) and my two cats (Cocoa and Cinnamon). My wife and I are both originally from the Southern New Jersey area, about an hour outside of Philadelphia. 

Professionally, I am passionate about Bayesian Statistics, Machine Learning, and all ways of using data to make better decisions. I've worked to apply data science in a wide variety of contexts. 

Personally, I love to read. my favorite thing to read are biographies and memoirs, but I am happy reading anything.
