title: About Me
---

I'm a data scientist currently looking for opportunities. My professional interests include statistics, data analysis, data visualization as well as R and Python programming. I particularly enjoy building Bayesian models in Stan and leveraging the great R packages created around that. 

When I'm not working on statistics problems, I love to read memoirs and biographies. Additionally, I follow all Philadelphia sports teams a passionate Formula One fan.  I live in Los Angeles with my wife and two cats.
